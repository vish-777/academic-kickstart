The company decided to fact-check some posts after concerns of widespread fake news on the platform, but in September said it would not extend the same moderation to political advertising. Politicians have lambasted the company for it, as have some of Facebook's own employees. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained steadfast in his argument that political advertising is equivalent to political speech. As recently as this week, Zuckerberg said in an interview with CBS This Morning cohost Gayle King, "In a democracy it's really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying so they can make their own judgments. I don't think that a private company should be censoring politicians or news."<a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-political-ads-fact-check-label-2019-12">more info</a>

But a new report on Friday in the Washington Post reveals that Facebook is considering some major structural changes to how it shows political ads.

Specifically, Facebook is considering a label on political ads that spells out that they haven't been fact-checked.
