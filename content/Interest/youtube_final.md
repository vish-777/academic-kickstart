In September, a group of YouTubers released a blacklist of keywords that would instantly get YouTube videos demonetized if used in the title. This was the latest of several reports about YouTube blacklists this year.

However, in a recent interview with YouTuber Juanpa Zurita, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has denied that the company uses blacklists.."<a href = "https://reclaimthenet.org/susan-wojcicki-no-youtube-blacklists/">more info</a>

Several former Google engineers, including Mike Wacker, have also said that YouTube has used blacklists to manipulate its search results via a file called “youtube_controversial_query_blacklist.”

According to Wacker, this file could be manually manipulated to switch to an alternate algorithm that essentially censors and suppresses politically “sensitive” topics.
