In this project we do the following tasks through these steps:

1)importing FIFA20 players dataset and take a look at the columns.
2)prepare our dataset for Data exploration by dropping useless columns and calculating new features.
3)Plotting a scatter plot to see the relationship between the Overall ratings and age of the players and their price.
4)Plotting a pie chart to see the proportion of right-foot players and left-foot players.
5)Creating a method to plot a Scatterpolar for comparing a Players growth over Time.
