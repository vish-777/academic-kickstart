<ul>
<li> Successfully reproduced the results of the paper: <a href = "https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryf7ioRqFX" target = "_blank">H-detach: Modifying the LSTM gradient towards better optimization</a>. Was able to prove the claims mentioned in the paper. Wrote CUDA code for the proposed algorithm to speed up execution by 2x. Also wrote a reproducibility review for the paper on <a href = "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryf7ioRqFX&noteId=ryf7ioRqFX" target = "_blank">openreview site</a>. </li>
