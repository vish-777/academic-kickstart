<ul>
<li> This was a fun project I built to better understand back-propagation operation and how they are implemented in libraries like <a href ="https://pytorch.org/" target = "_blank"> pytorch </a> and <a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org/" target = "_blank">tensorflow</a>.</li>
<li> It builds a dynamic computation graph similar to PyTorch. It correctly handles optimization and gradient flow using the backpropagation algorithm for various operations defined in a computation graph (eg: convolutional layers, fully connected layers, sigmoid, softmax etc.).</li>
</ul>
