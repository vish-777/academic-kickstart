An automated onboarding process is a sigh of relief to HR representatives & Reporting Managers. In reality, these new employee onboarding techniques benefit teams beyond the HR department; those in Finance and Operations, for example, can concentrate on more strategic tasks with the help of modern HR management systems.
The start of a new employeeâ€™s journey in a company begins with onboarding. A large part of what determines the future success of new employees is how smoothly the onboarding process is performed. Additionally, each new employee represents risk and a temporary loss of productivity for the company, especially if they are replacing a more experienced former employee. In the past year, Millennials in the workplace changed jobs three times more than their older coworkers, representing a loss of $30.5 billion in turnover costs annually. Therefore, it is worth investing money to ensure that new employees stick around.
Investing in a workflow automation software tool can help increase new hire retention rates while freeing up HR and IT resources for more important tasks.
