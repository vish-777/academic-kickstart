This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks:

1)Import libraries and datasets.

2)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

3)Perform Data Visualization.

4)Create Training and Testing Datasets.

5)Train and Evaluate a Linear Regression Model.

6)Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model.

7)Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Model.

8)Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs.
