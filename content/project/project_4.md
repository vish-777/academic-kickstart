<ul>
<li> Built a website to speed up relief operations during floods.</li>
<li> My work was to extract tweets from Twitter and running sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine whether the user was in floods and then extracting the location of the tweet if he was in trouble.</li>
<li> I also built a clustering algorithm that smartly assigns organizations running rescue operations to clusters of people to speed up the rescue.</li>
</ul>
