I am a computer science student at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. I am currently in my 4th year and interested in Digital marketing,Software Engineering,Software Analyst and Artificial Intelligence. I have had a wide variety of experience in these fields . I have worked projects on Employee Onboarding Automation , Internet of technologies in factory automation and security.

In my free time, I watch a lot of movies and I love to read. Reading is my hobby. I read books belonging to all genres. But it is adventure and mystery stories that keep me the most engaged. I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. They are fascinating stories that keep me very captivated. I can read them over and over again and I enjoy them. I also love to read the Harry Potter series of books by JK Rowling. She has woven so much magic through her stories. I also liked reading books by Enid Blyton.
